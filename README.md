Inter Finance is a dynamic web application that displays real-time stock prices, profiling, news, and ratings of S&P 500 companies. It uses public finance APIs "yfinance" and "financialmodelingprep" to obtain up-to-date stock information of a company. The backend is written in Flask and uses multiple endpoints to search for relevant company data. The web application uses React as the frontend to present this information with a tab layout.
